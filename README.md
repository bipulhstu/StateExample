// @State - State in SwiftUI is a property wrapper that allows you to store values that can
// change over time. When you mark a property with @State property wrapper, SwiftUI knows
// that it needs to monitor changes that property, and update any views that depend on it

// @Binding - Binding in SwiftUI is a property wrapper that allows you to create a two-way
// connection between a view and its underlying data. When you mark a property with the
// @Bindng property wrapper, you're indicating that the property's value is owned by some
// other view or object, and that your view needs to be notified when the value changes.
